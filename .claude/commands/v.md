## Workflow Protocol

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis (MANDATORY)
Before creating or modifying ANY code, you MUST:

1. **Analyze Existing Patterns**
   - Examine similar sections/blocks/snippets in the codebase
   - Identify naming conventions (classes, files, variables)
   - Study the structure and organization patterns
   - Review how data is passed between components
   - Understand the existing color scheme and styling system

2. **Identify Architecture**
   - Map out the relationship between sections, blocks, and snippets

   - Review CSS organization and naming methodology
   - Check how settings and schema are structured
   - Identify reusable components and utilities

3. **Review Related Code**
   - Read relevant snippets that might be referenced
   - Check assets for related JavaScript and CSS
   - Review locales for internationalization patterns
   - Examine config/settings for theme-wide options

### Phase 2: Planning
1. **Define Requirements**
   - Clarify the component's purpose and conversion goals
   - List all features and interactions needed
   - Identify potential edge cases

2. **Design Architecture**

   - Test thoroughly after fix
   - Ensure fix doesn't break other features
   - Update related code if needed

4. **Prevent Recurrence**
   - Add error handling if missing
   - Improve code robustness
   - Document the issue and solution

## Key Guidelines
